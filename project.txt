but its not required for us...right now
ok na

http://localhost/dashboard/ - by default , whatever screen we are seeing now in browser...that enter thing is called dashboard project

					-- similar to dashboard project, we have created / pasted our project folder whose name is Project...right. so

now our project url will be --- http://localhost/your_project_folder_name - then apache will load index.html of your project

so our actual project url , which we need to enter in browser is : http://localhost/Project


DB connection steps

first change your index.html into index.php.
then inside body tag, before closing of body tag.....database conneciton you can only write in php code only...
if you want t to diffrentiate php code  vs html code

any thing which is presented inside <?php ##This is where we have to write all php variables, php database conneciton and everything...select query.....even html code also we can write inside this##    ?> -- 

follow below link to connect with databse using php
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-insert-form-data-into-database-using-php/ --- ok

and create tables using phpmyadmin which is presented inside xampp control panel
if you want to access phpmyadmin in browser, you need to start mysql...similar to apache

ok
